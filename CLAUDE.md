# CLAUDE.md — Project State & Student Progress

## Project Overview

Go learning repository for a work experience student. Ten progressive exercises
using **only the Go standard library** (plus Docker and Docker Compose for three
exercises, and `go-redis` for the capstone).

## Module

`github.com/student-dev/go-starter` — Go 1.26, macOS ARM64.

- [ ] Task 08 — Capstone Link Shortener completed
- [ ] Task 09 — Docker Compose completed
- [ ] Task 10 — Capstone Link Shortener with Redis completed

## Memory

Key decisions and context for this project:

- Standard library only — no third-party packages (exception: Task 10 uses `go-redis`).
- Tests are the source of truth; exercises 01–08 each have a `main_test.go`.
  Exercises 05, 09, 10 use shell scripts for testing (Docker exercises).
- The mock server from Task 02 is reused in Task 03's tests to validate the client.
- Task 06 teaches file I/O — the fundamental gap before building the capstone.
- Task 07 introduces POST, stream-based JSON, and ServeMux method patterns.
- Task 08 is the capstone — combines maps, mutexes, file persistence, handlers, and redirects.
- Task 09 introduces Docker Compose with replicas and Nginx load balancing.
- Task 10 is the final capstone — combines Redis, Docker Compose, HTTP handlers, and redirects.

## Lessons Learned

Record any logic errors, unexpected behaviour, or corrections here to prevent
future regressions.

- All 4 tests (1 in Task 01, 1 in Task 02, 2 in Task 03) pass on initial setup.
- Task 03's test uses a local `mockMessageHandler` that replicates Task 02's
  handler, keeping the test self-contained (no cross-package imports needed).
- `TestFetchMessageBadURL` verifies the client handles connection errors gracefully.
- Task 04 has 3 tests (correctness, concurrency timing, empty input) — total now 7.
- Task 04's timing test asserts 5×200ms tasks complete in <500ms to prove concurrency.
- Task 05 uses a shell script for testing instead of `main_test.go` (Docker exercises
  don't fit Go's test framework). The `05-docker/answers/` directory has its own
  `go.mod` so the Docker build context is self-contained.
- Task 06 has 4 tests (read, filter, write, not-found) — total now 11.
- Task 07 has 4 tests (GET message, POST greet, empty name, bad JSON) — total now 15.
- Task 07 uses `http.NewServeMux()` with Go 1.22+ method patterns (`"GET /message"`, `"POST /greet"`).
- Task 08 has 5 tests (shorten, redirect, not-found, empty URL, persistence) — total now 20.
- Task 08's redirect test uses `http.Client{CheckRedirect: ...}` to prevent following the redirect.
- Task 08's `LoadFromFile` sets `next = len(links)` so new keys don't collide with loaded ones.
- 20 Go tests (1+1+2+3+4+4+5) across exercises 01–08, plus 3 shell-script-tested exercises (05, 09, 10).
- Task 09 uses Docker Compose with 3 replicas + Nginx; test script verifies multiple hostnames appear.
- Task 09's server uses `os.Hostname()` — inside containers, this returns the container ID.
- Task 09 uses `expose` (internal only) for web replicas and `ports` (host-mapped) for Nginx.
- Docker DNS resolves the service name `web` to all replica IPs for Nginx upstream round-robin.
- Task 10 uses `go-redis` (`github.com/redis/go-redis/v9`) — the first third-party dependency.
- Task 10's `INCR "link:next"` starts at 1 (not 0 like the old counter) — keys are "1", "2", "3".
- Task 10 needs no mutex — Redis handles concurrency atomically.
- Task 10's persistence test restarts only the app container (not Redis) to verify data survives.
- Task 10's Dockerfile copies `go.mod`+`go.sum` before code for dependency layer caching.
- `json.NewEncoder(w).Encode()` adds a trailing `\n` — tests use `json.NewDecoder` which handles this.
